I'm excited to be starting my personal blog with Gatsby! For quite some time I've been working on web projects either professionally or just to improve my dev skills. I thought it was time to create a space where I can share some things I learn along the way and to convey my thoughtfeelz in a place that isn't social media. Here's hoping I can keep this thing updated! ;p
