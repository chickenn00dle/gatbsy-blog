# Gatsby For BLOG.RZMY.WIN

This is the Gatsby project I set up for blog.rzmy.win. It's meant to be a minimal and lightweight blog to replace social media. If you'd like to get started with your own, feel free to use this project as a starting point!

## Getting Started

```
npm install -g gatsby-cli

```
git clone https://github.com/chickenn00dle/gatbsy-blog.git [project name]

```

Then run yarn to install dependencies:

yarn
```

Finally, start development server:

```
gatsby develop

That's it, you're ready to start building
